# Intrinsic spherical smoothing method based on generalized BÃ©zier curves and sparsity inducing penalization
The method aims to smooth the data points observed along time points.
We use the shperical B\'ezier curves and local penalization scheme.

Let $\set{(t_n, y_n)}_{n=1}^N$ be a set of data, 
where $t_n \in \mc{I}$ are the given time points 
and $y_n$ are the associated data points on $\mb{S}$. Our goal is to find a spherical B\'ezier curve that fits the data well.
